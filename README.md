#H1 VanillaJS version of movieApp, which comes from skyGate recruitment task.

Task's description:

TODO:
- ~~**Parse the array of objects, display them in unordered list**~~

- **Remove "validateTime" function from constructor, actually it should be merged with validateTimeArray function**
- **One button to rule and sort them all by either price or name**


- ~~**For each film, print list of starting hours after click / hover-over and estimated length**~~
- ~~**Hide those hours, which customer is not able to watch, cause won't manage to get to the cinema in time**~~
- ~~**If price is lesser than 10pln, attach "discount" label next to the price / color it differently, if price is greater than 50pln, only print "Above 50pln"**~~

- Responsive design: display list and "switches" differently in mobile/PCs
- Check whether there is "move API", if so - fetch data form it
